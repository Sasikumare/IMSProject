In this project We are able to store all the information of the Items available in the Inventory. To build this application i have used the Spring Initilizr and added dependencies Spring Web, Spring Data JPA and MySQl Driver. 
After generating the project i have wrote the database connection code in the applicationproperties.xml file.
Created an Item Model class with properties as itemId, itemName, itemPrice, itemQuantity making itemId as Primary key and Autogenerated value.
